# MediaBazzar Project 

During the second semester, I participated in a group project for a media bazaar company, which required the development of a software solution that enables administrators to manage employees and stock. The software solution was implemented using C# with Windows Forms and ASP.Net Core Razor Pages, with a MySQL database being used to store and manage the employees and stock.

The Windows Forms application was designed to manage employees by allowing administrators to add them to the system and assign them to departments and shifts. To manage employee scheduling, a scheduling algorithm was developed and implemented in the Windows Forms application. The algorithm assigns employees to their shifts based on their availability, which they set through the Razor Pages application. The Razor Pages application was designed for employees to set their availability and manage their personal data.

Throughout the development process, user experience and feedback were given a high priority. Best practices such as hiding sensitive data were followed to ensure user privacy and security. Collaboration with a tutor through mandatory weekly meetings helped guide the development of the project, and spring meetings with the client were held to gain feedback and implement it for the next sprint.

Overall, the software solution developed provides a user-friendly platform for administrators to manage employees and stock effectively, with an intuitive and straightforward interface. By prioritizing user experience and feedback, the solution meets the needs of the client while also providing a solid foundation for future development and expansion.
